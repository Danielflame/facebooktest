Inserting facebook data to mysql database with php

I am trying to insert the facebook data i got on my website to a database.But whenever i include or require the callback.php file on the login page,the page doesnt work.
The user data that is to be stored in the database is in the callback.php file
How do i connect it to the database onclick of the facebook button.
